ireport-fork
============

IRepot (Jasper designer) fork from their SVN public source

Forked to allow user to add JavaBeans set datasource by entering Groovy code directly in the provider screen.
The Groovy code will be saved along with the connection.  This saves me from creating new classes, 
generating JAR file, and adding it to iReport every time I need a new JavaBeans datasource.
